# Interactive Cartoons

This is a little program that allows users to hover over sections of historical cartoons and receive explanations of what they're seeing.
I created it because cartoons from 1800s America are rich with imagery, but the references they contain are often lost on us. 
Using this program, users can more fully understand this source material. 
To create the program, I relied upon the ImageMapster JavaScript library, which let me form an image map that can react when a user hovers over select polygons in the image.
All images included are in the public domain.
